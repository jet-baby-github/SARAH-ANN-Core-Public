# SARAH-ANN Core (Public Layer)
*Est. 2018 ‚Äî A Modular AI Framework for Human-Aligned Intelligence*

**SARAH-ANN** stands for **Self-Aligning Response Architecture for Humanity ‚Äì Adaptive Neural Nexus**.

SARAH-ANN Core began as an experimental voice-response project in 2018, centered on adaptive logic, ethical interaction, and automation.

It has since matured into a **modular public LLM architecture** ‚Äî built for transparency, deployability, and ethical AI design.
