> An early AI concept project focused on voice response and adaptive logic.

Built as a prototype neural network design for interpreting speech and generating data-guided responses.

This project marked the beginning of my AI and automation journey. Today, I’m working on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and private LLM deployments, but this is where it all started.
